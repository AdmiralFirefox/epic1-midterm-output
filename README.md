# Python Turtle Mandala Patterns

Mandala is one of the most popular types of patterns to color in the trend of coloring as a form of relaxation. Mandalas are geometric patterns that are usually circular in shape. Drawing and coloring a mandala is a form of meditation for some people. They relax, their mind becomes quiet, and they may enter into a spiritual space as they concentrate on coloring in the patterns of the form.

As one of our midterm requirements in our Computer Graphics and Visual Computing Subject, we are tasked to make a mandala pattern through coding, utilizing python's turtle library. I have made three patterns and each of them has a unique design. They are:

* [Flower Power](#flower-power)
* [Dream Catcher](#dream-catcher)
* [Star Explosion](#star-explosion)

<br />

## Flower Power
This pattern particularly represents a flower. The term "flower power" has come to be associated with the 1960s. This slogan was used to describe the passive, peaceful resistance movement that arose in response to the Vietnam War. The flower became known as a symbol of non-violence and harmony. And as a tribute, I made a unique pattern just for that.

## Dream Catcher
Dream catchers are made to protect sleepers, especially children, from bad dreams, nightmares, and evil spirits. The meanings of each part of the dream catcher were linked to the physical world. One notable meaning is that the round shape of the dream catcher represents the earth's spherical character. During the night, the web absorbs bad dreams and releases them during the day. There are various designs on the dream catcher's web inside the circle and decided to implement a unique pattern based on the commonly used ones.

## Star Explosion
When a star reaches the end of its life, it explodes in a brilliant burst of light known as a supernova. It is beautiful and terrifying at the same time and that's why I decided to implement it. I implemented a pattern where a red supergiant is on a brink of an explosion. The patterned sphere represents a red supergiant and the petal-like pattern inside it represents the amount of light and energy it's about to release as it's about to explode.

### Output:
